.PP
The functions in this module provide interfaces for a program to access data stored in program space (flash memory) of the device. In order to use these functions, the target device must support either the \fCLPM\fP or \fCELPM\fP instructions.
.PP
\fBNote:\fP
.RS 4
These functions are an attempt to provide some compatibility with header files that come with IAR C, to make porting applications between different compilers easier. This is not 100% compatibility though (GCC does not have full support for multiple address spaces yet).
.PP
If you are working with strings which are completely based in ram, use the standard string functions described in \fB<string.h>: Strings\fP.
.PP
If possible, put your constant tables in the lower 64 KB and use \fBpgm_read_byte_near()\fP or \fBpgm_read_word_near()\fP instead of \fBpgm_read_byte_far()\fP or \fBpgm_read_word_far()\fP since it is more efficient that way, and you can still use the upper 64K for executable code. All functions that are suffixed with a \fC_P\fP \fIrequire\fP their arguments to be in the lower 64 KB of the flash ROM, as they do not use ELPM instructions. This is normally not a big concern as the linker setup arranges any program space constants declared using the macros from this header file so they are placed right after the interrupt vectors, and in front of any executable code. However, it can become a problem if there are too many of these constants, or for bootloaders on devices with more than 64 KB of ROM. \fIAll these functions will not work in that situation.\fP
.PP
For \fBXmega\fP devices, make sure the NVM controller command register (\fCNVM.CMD\fP or \fCNVM_CMD\fP) is set to 0x00 (NOP) before using any of these functions.

Compare two strings with limited length. The \fBstrncmp_PF()\fP function is similar to \fBstrcmp_PF()\fP except it only compares the first (at most) \fIn\fP characters of \fIs1\fP and \fIs2\fP 
.PP
\fBParameters:\fP
.RS 4
\fIs1\fP A pointer to the first string in SRAM

.RS 4
The \fBstrncmp_PF()\fP function returns an integer less than, equal to, or greater than zero if \fIs1\fP (or the first \fIn\fP bytes thereof) is found, respectively, to be less than, to match, or be greater than \fIs2\fP. The contents of RAMPZ SFR are undefined when the function returns

.PP

.SS "char * strncpy_PF (char * dst, \fBuint_farptr_t\fP src, size_t n)"
.PP
Duplicate a string until a limited length. The \fBstrncpy_PF()\fP function is similar to \fBstrcpy_PF()\fP except that not more than \fIn\fP bytes of \fIsrc\fP are copied. Thus, if there is no null byte among the first \fIn\fP bytes of \fIsrc\fP, the result will not be null-terminated
.PP
In the case where the length of \fIsrc\fP is less than that of \fIn\fP, the remainder of \fIdst\fP will be padded with nulls

\fIsrc\fP A far pointer to the source string in Flash

.SS "size_t strnlen_PF (\fBuint_farptr_t\fP s, size_t len)"
.PP
Determine the length of a fixed-size string. The \fBstrnlen_PF()\fP function is similar to \fBstrnlen()\fP, except that \fIs\fP is a far pointer to a string in program space
.PP

.RS 4
\fIs\fP A far pointer to the string in Flash

\fIlen\fP The maximum number of length to return
.RE
.PP
\fBReturns:\fP
.RS 4
The strnlen_PF function returns strlen_P(\fIs\fP), if that is less than \fIlen\fP, or \fIlen\fP if there is no '\\0' character among the first \fIlen\fP characters pointed to by \fIs\fP. The contents of RAMPZ SFR are undefined when the function returns 
.RE
.PP

.SS "char * strstr_PF (const char * s1, \fBuint_farptr_t\fP s2)"
.PP
Locate a substring. The \fBstrstr_PF()\fP function finds the first occurrence of the substring \fCs2\fP in the string \fCs1\fP. The terminating '\\0' characters are not compared. The \fBstrstr_PF()\fP function is similar to \fBstrstr()\fP except that \fCs2\fP is a far pointer to a string in program space.
.PP
\fBReturns:\fP
.RS 4
The \fBstrstr_PF()\fP function returns a pointer to the beginning of the substring, or NULL if the substring is not found. If \fCs2\fP points to a string of zero length, the function returns \fCs1\fP. The contents of RAMPZ SFR are undefined when the function returns 
.RE
.PP

.SS "char* strtok_P (char * s, PGM_P delim)"
.PP
Parses the string into tokens. \fBstrtok_P()\fP parses the string \fCs\fP into tokens. The first call to \fBstrtok_P()\fP should have \fCs\fP as its first argument. Subsequent calls should have the first argument set to NULL. If a token ends with a delimiter, this delimiting character is overwritten with a '\\0' and a pointer to the next character is saved for the next call to \fBstrtok_P()\fP. The delimiter string \fCdelim\fP may be different for each call.
.PP
The \fBstrtok_P()\fP function is similar to \fBstrtok()\fP except that \fCdelim\fP is pointer to a string in program space.
.PP
\fBReturns:\fP
.RS 4
The \fBstrtok_P()\fP function returns a pointer to the next token or NULL when no more tokens are found.
.RE
.PP
\fBNote:\fP
.RS 4
\fBstrtok_P()\fP is NOT reentrant. For a reentrant version of this function see strtok_rP().
